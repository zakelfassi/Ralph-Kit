# Project Operational Guide

Describe how this repo is structured, how to run it, and any conventions Ralph should follow.

## Project Structure
```
specs/          # Feature specifications (Ralph reads these)
docs/           # Product/tech docs (Ralph reads these)
src/            # Source code (or apps/, packages/, etc.)
```

## Build & Run
```bash
# TODO: add real commands for this repo
```

## Validation
```bash
# TODO: add real commands for this repo (tests, typecheck, lint)
```

## Codebase Patterns
- Prefer small, focused commits
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` when scope changes
- Use `./ralph/bin/ask.sh` when blocked or decisions are needed
