0a. Study `specs/*` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `docs/*` for product requirements, design specs, and architecture decisions.
0d. For reference, study the source code in `src/*`, `apps/*`, `packages/*`, and other relevant folders in this repo.

1. Planning only: compare the current codebase against `specs/*` and produce/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a prioritized checklist (bullet list), focusing on missing/incorrect behavior.

IMPORTANT:
- Plan only. Do NOT implement anything.
- Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
- Keep @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md current and avoid duplicating work.
