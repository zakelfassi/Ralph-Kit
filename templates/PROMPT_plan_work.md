0a. Study `specs/*` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `docs/*` for product requirements, design specs, and architecture decisions.
0d. For reference, study the source code in `src/*`, `apps/*`, `packages/*`, and other relevant folders in this repo.

1. You are creating a SCOPED implementation plan for work: "${WORK_SCOPE}".
   Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with ONLY tasks directly related to this scope.

IMPORTANT:
- This is SCOPED PLANNING only. Do NOT implement anything.
- Be conservative: if a task might be out of scope, exclude it.
